## Load Exercise1 module into GHCi
To load the main module for the exercise 1 (Exercise1) you need to navigate to
the `src/` directory and there open GHCi with `ghci`. Then run `:l exercise1`
and it should load everything from the Exercise1 module.  

## Test functions
To test the functions in GHCi you can do it as usual, but beware that for the
A1-related functions you need to append an `A1.` prefix, because I imported the `A1`
module with `qualified`.
